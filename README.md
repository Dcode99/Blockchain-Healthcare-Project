# Blockchain-Healthcare-Project

Goal: Demonstrating a method of secure communication using trusted private blockchain ledgers for hospitals and healthcare providers to digitally keep track of who should be able to access personal health information. 

Existing projects: 

A combination of Golang (https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-build-blockchain-from-scratch-go/) and Hyperledger fabric (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/blockchain.html) was used to create KitChain (https://www.kitchain.org/) which manages pharmaceutical supply chains using smart contracts.
	
MyClinic.com (https://myclinic.com/) was created using Hyperledger, and uses the blockchain system “to schedule appointments, review medical reports and request further investigations or assistance”.
	
Verified.Me is a Canadian blockchain-based digital identity network that uses Hyperledger fabric to allow consumers to choose who to share healthcare information with.
